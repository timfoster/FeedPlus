This is a very simple Python script that pulls the public feed for any
given Google+ ID, and saves an Atom 1.0 xml file, "atom.xml" in that
directory.  It also has the option to write the posts directly to
Twitter as well.

Given my focus on Twitter here, the Atom I'm producing truncates summaries
to 140 chars, and when it does so, will include the permalink to the original
G+ post.

The following Python libraries are required:

google-api-python-client-1.0beta6
    http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list

python-gflags-1.6
    http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/downloads/list

python-twitter-0.8.2/
    http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/downloads/list

Usage: feedplus.py <G+ id> [ -d <dir> ] [True|False]

The last argument is a boolean, telling feedplus whether you'd like it
to automatically post updates to Twitter.  If so, the first time you
run it, it'll ask for oAuth access to your Twitter account, and will
save access keys in ~/.feedplusrc.

[feedplus]
oauth_token_secret = <feedplus will write this for you>
oauth_token = <feedplus will write this for you>
# sample datestamp
last_post = 2011-12-13T03:53:54.435Z

The first time it posts to Twitter, it'll create .feedplusrc in
your home directory, and will write the key "last_post", indicating
the latest datestamp of the post it has written to Twitter.

If you delete that file, you'll get duplicate posts appearing in your
Twitter feed.


Finally, the Twitter support is new, and largely untested: try running
fp_twitter.py which will just do the oAuth dance, then print out some
of your current timeline.
