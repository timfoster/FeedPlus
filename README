This is a very simple Python script that pulls the public feed for any
given Google+ ID, and saves an Atom 1.0 xml file, "atom.xml" in that
directory.

Given my focus on Twitter here, the Atom I'm producing truncates summaries
to 140 chars, and when it does so, will include the permalink to the original
G+ post.

The following Python libraries are required:

google-api-python-client-1.0beta6
    http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list

python-gflags-1.6
    http://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/downloads/list

Usage: feedplus.py <G+ id> <dir>
